A balance sheet is a financial statement that reports a company's assets, liabilities and shareholder equity.
The balance sheet is one of the three core financial statements that are used to evaluate a business.
It provides a snapshot of a company's finances (what it owns and owes) as of the date of publication.
The balance sheet adheres to an equation that equates assets with the sum of liabilities and shareholder equity.
Fundamental analysts use balance sheets to calculate financial ratios.
