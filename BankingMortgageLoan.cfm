A mortgage is a loan used to purchase or maintain a home, plot of land, or other real estate.
The borrower agrees to pay the lender over time, typically in a series of regular payments
divided into principal and interest. The property then serves as collateral to secure the loan.

A borrower must apply for a mortgage through their preferred lender and ensure that 
they meet several requirements, including minimum credit scores and down payments. 
Mortgage applications undergo a rigorous underwriting process before they reach the closing phase. 
Mortgage types, such as conventional or fixed-rate loans, vary based on the borrower's needs.
If you can not pay the mortgage loan,property or land will be taken.
