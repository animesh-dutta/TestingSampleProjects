Encapsulation: The binding (or wrapping) of data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit called a ‘class’. It also means hiding data (i.e., private variables) from direct access.
Abstraction: Hiding the complex implementation details of an operation while exposing a simple interface.
Inheritance: Allows a new class to inherit properties and methods of an existing class.
Polymorphism: The ability of different classes to provide a unique interface by exposing a method that can behave differently.
