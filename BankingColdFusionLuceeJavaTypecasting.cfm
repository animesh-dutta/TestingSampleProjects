Typecasting is the process of converting a variable from one type to another. In Java, there are two types of casting:

Widening Casting (Implicit): automatic type conversion from a smaller to a larger type
Narrowing Casting (Explicit): needs explicit conversion to convert a larger type to a smaller type
