Score providers, such as the three nationwide credit bureaus -- Equifax, Experian and TransUnion -- and companies like FICO use different 
types of credit scoring models and may use different information to calculate credit scores. Credit scores provided by
the three nationwide credit bureaus will also vary because some lenders may report information to all three, two or one, or none at all.  
And lenders and creditors may use additional information, other than credit scores, to decide whether to grant you credit.
