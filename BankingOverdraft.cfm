An overdraft happens when you don't have enough money available to cover a purchase or a payment. 
Another way of saying this is an overdraft happens when a transaction exceeds your available balance.
When this happens, we'll either pay it for you, overdrawing your account, or we'll decline it or return it unpaid. 
We make this decision at our discretion based on several factors such as the transaction amount and your account history.
