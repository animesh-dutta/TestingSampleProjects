Internal auditors play the critical role of being the third line of defense.
When risk owners and management do not identify risk or adequately mitigate the risk,
it is imperative for the internal auditors to provide independent and objective insight on risk. 
The audit management solutions market caters to this need by 
automating internal audit operations through its primary and secondary offerings. 
Audit management solutions help manage the 
complexity of the auditor's role,
not the organization's risk.
